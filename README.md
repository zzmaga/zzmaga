I am a Python/Go developer. I tried myself in many directions, tried to learn C++, C, Java, but most of all I was hooked on GO development! I studied Python at University and at the Skillbox and Skillfactory courses. At the moment, my studies on the course have been completed and I am looking for a job, at the same time I am studying at ENU University in the specialty Computer Engineering and Software.
